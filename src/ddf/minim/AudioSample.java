 * An <code>AudioSample</code> keeps the entire file in an internal buffer and

 * the sound even if it is still playing back. It is not advised that you use
 * this class for long sounds (like entire songs, for example) because the
 * entire file is kept in memory.
 * <p>
 * To create an AudioSample you must use either the loadSample or createSample 
 * methods of the Minim class.

 * AudioSample also provides most of the same methods as AudioPlayer for
 * controlling volume, panning, and so forth.
