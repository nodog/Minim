	Minim is an audio library that uses the
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/doc-sampled.html">
		JavaSound API
	</a>, a bit of <a href="http://www.tritonus.org">Tritonus</a>, and Javazoom's
	<a href="http://www.javazoom.net/mp3spi/mp3spi.html">MP3SPI</a> to
	provide an easy to use audio library for people developing in the
	Processing environment. The philosophy behind the API is to make
	integrating audio into your sketches as simple as possible while still
	providing a reasonable amount of flexibility for more advanced users.
	There are no callbacks and you do not ever need to directly manipulate
	sample arrays, all of the dirty work is handled for you. The download
	comes in two flavors: (1) just the jar files needed to use Minim and
	(2) a full distribution that includes the javadocs, examples, and
	source code. Minim is licensed under the
	<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0-standalone.html">GNU
		Lesser General Public License</a> (LGPL), a copy of which is included with
	both distributions. Users of Minim 1.1 should peruse the
	<a href="http://code.compartmental.net/minim/javadoc/">Javadocs</a> to
	see what's changed (hint: not much has changed, but there are a couple
	of nice new things).

	<h1>Minim 2.1.0 Beta</h1>
	
	The next version of Minim is currently available as a Beta build.
	The big new feature is a music programming framework built around the
	concept of a unit generator (UGen). This framework makes it possible to
	intuitively create synthesis chains and schedule notes to be played
	with these chains. You can read about the framework beginning in the
	Minim Manual at the
	<a
		href="http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/manual-music-programming-intro/">Music
		Programming Intro</a> section. You can also peruse the Javadocs for the
	Beta build online at
	<a href="http://code.compartmental.net/minim-beta/javadoc/">http://code.compartmental.net/minim-beta/javadoc/</a>.
	The package ddf.minim.ugens contains all of the new music programming
	classes.

	<h1>Installation</h1>
	
	To install either distribution, unzip the file into the
	<strong>libraries</strong> folder in your sketchbook. Create this
	directory if it doesn't exist. The zip should extract a directory named
	<strong>minim</strong>. You will then need to remove the version of
	Minim that is included with Processing.
	<p>
	<strong>On OSX:</strong> Find your Processing.app and right click,
	choose "Show Package Contents". Then dig down to
	Contents/Resources/Java/modes/java/libraries and delete the minim
	folder in there.
	<p>
	<strong>On Windows:</strong> From the directory that contains
	Processing.exe, dig down to modes/java/libraries and delete the minim
	folder there. Finally,
	<strong>restart Processing</strong>. Here are some of the features of
	Minim:
	<ul>
		<li>AudioPlayer: Mono and Stereo playback of WAV, AIFF, AU, SND,
			and MP3 files.</li>
		<li>AudioMetaData: An object filled with metadata about a file,
			such as ID3 tags.</li>
		<li>AudioRecorder: Mono and Stereo audio recording either
			buffered or direct to disk.</li>
		<li>AudioInput: Mono and Stereo input monitoring.</li>
		<li>AudioOutput: Mono and Stereo sound synthesis.</li>
		<li>AudioSignal: A simple interface for writing your own sound
			synthesis classes.</li>
		<li>Comes with all the standard waveforms, a pink noise generator
			and a white noise generator. Additionally, you can extend the
			Oscillator class for easy implementation of your own periodic
			waveform.</li>
		<li>AudioEffect: A simple interface for writing your own audio
			effects.</li>
		<li>Comes with low pass, high pass, band pass, and notch filters.
			Additionally, you can extend the IIRFilter class for easy
			implementation of your own IIR filters.</li>
		<li>Easy to attach signals and effects to AudioInputs and
			AudioOutputs. All the mixing and processing is taken care of for you.</li>
		<li>Provides an FFT class for doing spectrum analysis.</li>
		<li>Provides a BeatDetect class for doing beat detection.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Planned Features:
	<ul>
		<li>More AudioEffects like reverb, delay, phasing, ring
			modulation, and bit crushing.</li>
		<li>Better filters using frequency domain filtering techniques.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	To start using Minim, you can take a look at the
	<a href="http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/quickstart">Quickstart
		Guide</a> or dive right into the
	<a href="http://code.compartmental.net/minim/javadoc">Javadocs</a>. If
	you have any questions about using the library you can
